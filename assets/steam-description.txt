[h1]Overview[/h1]

Are the Manifesti extremely unhappy with you?  This mod will help you make them quite a bit happier by fixing the impossible-to-fulfill
"Personal Autonomy for Munitions" demand.  Please note that part of the demand _also_ requires having 0 slave armies and 0 undead armies - something
that seems to be intentionally left vague in the tooltip by the developers.

[h1]Changes[/h1]

This mod replaces the [i]common/pop_faction_types/03_manifesti.txt[/i] file that defines the Manifesti faction.  The only changes are to
replace the conditions to satisfy the "Personal Autonomy for Munitions" demand.  It previously was requiring the technology "Autonomous Combat Computers"
and at least 1 ship with a computer component that was unlocked by the technology.  However, this technology is restricted to gestalt empires,
which can't have factions!  The intent seems to be that the Manifesti want weapons to be able to decide their own use, which for non-gestalt empires
would be accomplished with the "Sapient Combat Computers" technology.  The relevant references are changed to refer to this technology and the Sapient
computer components unlocked by it.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
 
Because it replaces a core Stellaris file, this mod is inherently incompatible with any other mods that overwrite the same file.  Generally,
any mod that alters the Manifesti faction will not be compatible with this one.  Altering other factions should work as expected because they
are defined in other files.

This mod is not compatible with achievements because it overwrites a core Stellaris file.

[h3]Post-Game Start[/h3]

This mod can be safely added or removed from your savegame after the game has started.  It only alters the Manifesti faction and will not alter your savegame.  If you remove it, your game will work normally.
